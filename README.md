# OOP - 2023/24 - Assignment 2

This is the base repository for assignment 2.
Please follow the instructions given in the [PDF](https://brightspace.rug.nl/content/enforced/243046-WBAI045-05.2023-2024.1/assignment%202_v1.1.pdf) for the content of the exercise.

## How to carry out your assignment

**PLEASE FOLLOW THESE STEPS:**

1. Use this template and create a private repository:
   ![](use_template.png)
2. Please add your partner and `oop-otoz` to the collaborators.
3. Create a new branch called `submission` **before adding any files**.
4. Add your code in the `main` branch (**IF YOU DO NOT ADD ANYTHING, THE PULL REQUEST WILL NOT WORK**).
5. Make sure that Actions are allowed: Settings -> Actions -> General -> Allow all actions and workflows.
6. Create a pull request from the `main` branch to your `submission` branch and check that your changes are captured.
7. Now finish your solution.
8. When you are ready to submit, add `oop-otoz` to the reviewers.

**Notes:**

- **Leave the \*\***init\***\*.py files untouched**.
- Do not move the `main.py` files.
- Do not move `requirements.txt`.
- Make the pull request AFTER SUBMITTING SOME CHANGES.

Below this line, you can write your report to motivate your design choices.

## Submission

The code should be submitted on GitHub by opening a Pull Request from the `main` branch on to the `submission` branch. This means that `submission` is the base branch and `main` the compare branch. **Make sure to push your code only to `main`!**

There are automated checks that verify that your submission is correct:

1. Deadline - checks that the last commit in a PR was made before the deadline.
2. Reproducibility - downloads libraries included in `requirements.txt` and runs `python3 main.py`. If your code does not throw any errors, it will be marked as reproducible. **Make sure it is reproducible before submission!**
3. Style - runs `flake8` on your code to ensure adherence to style guides.
4. Tests - runs `unittest` on your tests in `part_1/tests` to make sure all tests succeed.
